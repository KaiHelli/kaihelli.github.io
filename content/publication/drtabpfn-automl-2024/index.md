abstract: "While most ML models expect independent and identically distributed data,
  this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts,
  resulting in the degradation of machine learning model performance. Until now, no
  method has significantly outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores
  these shifts, with even smaller gains for tabular data. To address this, we present
  Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data
  Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire
  training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward
  pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets
  drawn from a prior that specifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based
  on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts
  of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary
  model parameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen
  datasets, runs in seconds, and needs no hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations
  across 18 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate large performance improvements
  over a wide range of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, and TabPFN. Compared to the
  strongest baselines, it improves accuracy from 0.688 to 0.744 and ROC AUC from 0.786
  to 0.832 while maintaining stronger calibration. This approach could serve as significant
  groundwork for further research on out-of-distribution prediction."
